                    <p class="py-2 para-light">He nods to you before a small scroll slips out of his sleeve into his hand. The stranger places it atop of a barrel next to him, before disappearing among the crowd. You take your time approaching the scroll, making sure that you do not draw attention to yourself. </p>
                    <p class="py-2 para-light">Your mind is already drawing its own conclusions from the encounter. As you reach the barrel, your hand scoops up the scroll in one swift movement. You lean against the wall with your back to the main street. With mild curiosity, you glance downward to the scroll in your hands, which is sealed with the symbol of your daimyō.</p>
                    <p class="py-2 para-light">The paper feels rough to your touch. Which means the message within is urgent. You feel your heart pound in your chest as you attempt to steady your breathing. A deep frown appears on your face as you break the seal and unfurl the scroll. </p>
                    <p class="py-2 para-light">The sudden sound of surprised and angry voices ring out all around you. There are people who you recognize as samurai, forcing their way through the crowd. You imagine similar scenes are playing out in other areas of the town. Without hesitating, you join the crowd making its way to the castle.  </p>
                    <p class="py-2 para-light">The peasants are quick to make a path for your group. There once excited conversations have turned subdued. The hint of fear and panic has crept into their tones. The guards at the gate bow as you pass through. As if they were expecting this.  </p>
                    <p class="py-2 para-light">Once inside, you notice your group is not the first to arrive. The atmosphere in the room where your daimyō holds court is stifling. Those recognizable as samurai kneel on one side. On the other, people who appear to be peasants. However, you know better.  </p>
